    "text": "Introduction:\nSocial media platforms, such as Twitter, have transformed the way in which information is disseminated and consumed on a global scale. These digital arenas enable a vast online community to quickly share and consume personal thoughts and professional insights, threaded through a variety of media forms. With over 500 million active users, Twitter has become particularly noteworthy for pinpointing the workings of information exchange and the features of content that make it most popular López-Goñi and Sánchez-Angulo (2017).\nIn their research on user activity in Twitter, Oh and Syn (2015) posit that human behavior in everyday life is driven by many factors, and is thus complex and multi-faceted. They uncover a useful lens for examining user activity in casual online environments, while Luo, Freeman, and Stefaniak (2020) report that mobile technology which will exceed 12.3 billion devices by 2022, over 90% of which will be smartphones is increasingly prevalent. This underscores the increasing relevance of social media platforms in the everyday sharing and transmission of information.\nThis research is fundamentally concerned with discerning the determinants of article popularity, as captured by the number of times each article was shared, to bring to light the many factors that drive user engagement and content diffusion. Using a massive dataset of articles and associated measures over a period of two years from Mashable (Fernandes and Sernadela (2015)) to build models that could more accurately identify the traits that result in the visibility and engagement of content published to social media. By exploring the relationship between shared articles’ characteristics and how popular they become, the hope is that this work may yield findings that offer guidance to both enterprise and solo publishers seeking to make their work more prevalent and persuasive in the digital enclave."

    "text": "Methods and Results\n\nBoxplot of Shares\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Boxplot of the variable of interest.\n\n\n\nThe variable of interest, shares, has a median of 1400 and a mean of 3377. The distribution spread is quite large, with a standard deviation of 9718. We will be using knn classification to determine whether an article will be popular. We will create a new variable called is_popular with two values 1 (popular) and 0 (unpopular)“. An article is classified as popular if it has equal to or more than 1400 shares and unpopular if it has less than 1400 shares. The model aims to predict whether an article will be popular based on the number of links, images, and videos in it. The dataset is publicly available and has 61 attributes out of which we chose 4 including the three predictors and the variable of interest, shares, which refers to the number of shares of the article in social networks.\nSince we will be performing classification, we split our data into a training and a testing set with a 60% proportion.\nWe start our preliminary data analysis process by examining the number of observations we have in the training set for each class.\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Class distribution of article popularity in training set\n\n\n\n\n\n\nis_popular\nn\npercentage\n\n\n\n\n0\n11094\n46.64088\n\n\n1\n12692\n53.35912\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Table 1, We can see that our data is balanced and since we have close percentages of data in both popular and unpopular classes, with popular holding the majority at 53.4 %.\nNext, we visualize the distributions of our predictor variables: num_hrefs, num_imgs, and num_videos. We use is_popular as the fill argument.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Histogram of number of links in popular and non-Popular articles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Histogram of number of images in popular and non-Popular articles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Histogram of number of videos in popular and non-Popular articles\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we start building our knn classification model and we build a tuning model for picking the best value of k. Then we perform cross-validation and create a workflow that calculate the metrics for each of the K values 1, 6, …, 100 then make an accuracy vs k plot.\n\n\nAccuracy vs k plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Results from 5-fold cross validation to choose K. (Accuracy was used as the classification metric as K was varied.)\n\n\n\nThe value of K that generates the highest accuracy is about 50, therefore we choose K = 50 and use that to build the model.We use a workflow to fit our model using our training set, predict the labels in our testing set, and incorporate the predictions as the new column .pred_class into the testing set.\nWe now look at the accuracy of the classifier using the testing set with the metrics function.\n\n\n\n\nTable 2: Summary of KNN model accuracy across different K values with 5-fold cross-validation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.metric\n.estimator\n.estimate\n\n\n\n\naccuracy\nbinary\n0.5451507\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Table 2, the accuracy of the classifier isn’t very high at 54.5%. Below is the confusion matrix of the classifier model.\n\n\n\n\nTable 3: Confusion matrix of Aarticle popularity predictions on test data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n1\n\n\n\n\n0\n5507\n5324\n\n\n1\n1889\n3138\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven that we care more about popular articles with higher shares, we take popular articles as the “positive” observations. So the true positive is 3138 and the false positive is 1889. The precision is therefore 0.6242 which is slightly higher than the accuracy of 0.5452. The recall is 0.3708 which is significantly lower than the accuracy. This suggests that the model is somewhat precise in predicting popular articles but is cautious and misses some actual instances of popular articles in doing so."

    "text": "Discussion:\nSummary: Our analysis aims to predict the number of shares an article published by Mashable over a period of two years will get based on the number of links, images and videos in the article using knn classification. An article is classified as popular if it has equal to or more than 1400 shares and unpopular if it has less than 1400 shares. Our findings suggest that the model is only somwhat reliable with an accuracy of 0.5452 with precision higher than accuracy but recall lower than accuracy.\nAre the findings as expected: Yes, this is what we expected. Given that a basic KNN model was used for prediction, it’s reasonable to assume that this simple model might be slightly underfitting. Consequently, we anticipate achieving improved outcomes by exploring more complex models.\nImpact of Findings: This insight has the potential to refine content creation strategies by enriching our comprehension of the elements that contribute to content’s engagement and popularity, such as identifying the ideal balance of links, images, and videos within an article. Adopting this strategy could significantly boost the future articles’ shareability.\nFuture Questions from Analysis: This analysis might lead to several Future questions. Firstly, whether there are more model models capable of achieving higher precision and recall. Secondly, the impact of the quality of links, images, and videos within articles on their popularity presents another area for in-depth investigation."
