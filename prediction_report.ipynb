        "Given that we care more about popular articles with higher shares, we take popular articles as the \"positive\" observations. The precision is therefore 0.6211 which is slightly higher than the accuracy of 0.546. The recall is 0.3844 which is significantly lower than the accuracy. This suggests that the model is somewhat precise in predicting popular articles but is cautious and misses some actual instances of popular articles in doing so.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Discussion:\n",
        "Summary: Our analysis aims to predict the number of shares an article published by Mashable over a period of two years will get based on the number of links, images and videos in the article using knn classification. An article is classified as popular if it has equal to or more than 1400 shares and unpopular if it has less than 1400 shares. Our findings suggest that the model is only somwhat reliable with an accuracy of 0.546 with precision higher than accuracy but recall lower than accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "Are the findings as expected:\n",
        "Yes, this is what we expected. Given that a basic KNN  model was used for prediction, it's reasonable to assume that this simple model might be slightly underfitting. Consequently, we anticipate achieving improved outcomes by exploring more complex models.\n",
        "\n",
        "Impact of Findings:\n",
        "This insight has the potential to refine content creation strategies by enriching our comprehension of the elements that contribute to content's engagement and popularity, such as identifying the ideal balance of links, images, and videos within an article. Adopting this strategy could significantly boost the future articles' shareability.\n",
        "\n",
        "Future Questions from Analysis:\n",
        "This analysis might lead to several Future questions. Firstly, whether there are more model models capable of achieving higher precision and recall. Secondly, the impact of the quality of links, images, and videos within articles on their popularity presents another area for in-depth investigation. \n",
